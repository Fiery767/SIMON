This project uses the library of LibGDX, which helps to speed up the design part of creating a game.

Link to the LibGDX website where we got the source code from :arrow_down: We also used Android Studio to create the app and we used Java to code the app.

Simon is a repeat memory game that allows the user to test their memory skills by pressing the sequence of colors that are displayed. The screen will output a sequence and then the player must copy the exact pattern correctly to move onto the next sequence. If the player fails to complete the sequence, the game will stop and will reset.
