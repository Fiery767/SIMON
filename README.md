This project uses the library of LibGDX, which helps to speed up the design part of creating a game.

Simon is a repeat memory game that allows the user to test their memory skills by pressing the sequence of colors that are displayed. The screen will output a sequence and then the player must copy the exact pattern correctly to move onto the next sequence. If the player fails ot complete the sequence, the game will stop and will reset.
